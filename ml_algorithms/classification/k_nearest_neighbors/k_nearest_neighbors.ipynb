    "Last time, we looked into one of the simplest classification algorithms in machine learning called [binomial logistic regression](http://www.enlistq.com/implementing-a-binomial-logistic-regression-model-in-python/). In this post, I am going to cover another common classification algorithm called K Nearest Neighbors, otherwise known as KNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, we have mostly discussed regression models such as simple and multivariate linear regression and polynomial regression which are used for predicting a quantity. On the other hand, classification models are used for predicting a category such as yes/no, will buy car/scooter/truck, will turn pink/green/red etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is another such classification model and once I am done explaining how it works, you will understand from where it gets its name. KNN is a supervised learning algorithm that follows 5 simple steps to predict a class:\n",
    "1. Pick a value for k - this is the number of neighbors you will consider for each new datapoint you want to predict a class for.\n",
    "2. Pick the neighbors - calculate distance from new datapoint to rest of the data points. The distance can be euclidean distance, manhattan distance or something else. \n",
    "3. Identify categories - Pick the k data points that are closest to new datapoint and then identify which category they belong to.\n",
    "4. Label - Label the new data point category which most k nearest data points belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points to remember about KNN algorithm are:\n",
    "- KNN doesn't make any assumptions about initial dataset unlike some other popular machine learning algorithms. This means that KNN can work with more diverse datasets and hence, can be more accurate.\n",
    "- KNN computes the results on the go. It memorizes the training dataset and then uses that to label the new dataset when it is run.\n",
    "- KNN doesn't scale well. It can be very slow for large datasets."

    "## Exploring the dataset\n",
    "For this example, we are going one of the most popular datasets in machine learning called the Iris dataset. Some of you might have heard of this dataset already. This data was collected by Fisher in 1933. It contains 4 features and a label. The features are:\n",

    "- sepal width\n",
    "- petal length\n",
    "- petal width\n",

    "## Splitting the dataset into training and testing set\n",
    "KNN is a supervised learning model (see my earlier post on [supervised and unsupervised models](http://www.enlistq.com/difference-between-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-models/)) which means we need to feed it some data first to train it. And, once it is trained, we need to test it on a different set of data to evaluate it. To do this, we need to split our dataset into training and testing set. Rule of thumb is to assign 80% of the dataset to training and 20% to testing."
