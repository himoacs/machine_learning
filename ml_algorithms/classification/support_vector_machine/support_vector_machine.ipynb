    "As you have probably noticed by now, there are several machine learning algorithms available at your disposal. In my previous post, I covered a very popular classification algorithm called K-Nearest Neighbors. In today's post, I will cover another very common and powerful classification algorithm called Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is SVM and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like KNN, SVM is a supervised learning model which means that it learns from the training set that we feed it. It can be used for both classification and regression problems but it's mostly used for classification. In this post, we will focus on using SVM for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM consists of picking support vectors and then using them to define a decision boundary for classifying features into different categories. The decision boundary is more formally known as hyperplane. Points on different sides of the plane belong to different categories. However, different sets of points can be segregated by numerous hyperplanes so how do you decide which hyperplane to select? That's where the support vectors come into the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are just data points in your dataset that help decide which hyperplane to pick. These data points are edge cases that define the boundaries of your class. For example, let's say you have a dataset consisting of different car models belonging to two different classes: Ferrari and Porche. The training data might have Ferraris that have same characteristics as a Porche and vice-versa. These are the data points that will end up being our support vectors. To pick the hyperplane, you need to calculate distance from nearest data point (can be of any class) to the hyperplane. This distance is called margin. The plane which results in the highest margin is chosen as our hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easy to accomplish when you have two classes that are linearly separable. What do you do when they aren't? In such scenarios, SVM will map the data points to a higher dimension (i.e. from 2d to 3d) so that classes can be separated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like KNN, SVM is better suited for smaller datasets and provides high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some useful posts to learn more about SVM models:\n",

    "## Exploring the dataset\n",
    "For this example, we are going one of the most popular datasets in machine learning called the Iris dataset. Some of you might have heard of this dataset already. This data was collected by Fisher in 1933. It contains 4 features and a label. The features are:\n",
    "- sepal length\n",
    "- sepal width\n",
    "- petal length\n",
    "- petal width\n",
    "\n",
    "and the label is the type of iris plant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to use these four features to correctly predict the type of iris plant. \n",

And, once it is trained, we need to test it on a different set of data to evaluate it. To do this, we need to split our dataset into training and testing set. Rule of thumb is to assign 80% of the dataset to training and 20% to testing."
